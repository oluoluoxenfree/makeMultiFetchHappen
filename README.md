# makeMultiFetchHappen




justify node-fetch
    say that it's under blah license
justify mocha
say how to build tests
tests: works, doesn't work, any others?
validate that all urls are strings, throw error if not
all non-null strings (typeof x is string)


more time:

add error that says which url has thrown
add js doc build step
